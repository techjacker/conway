![grid](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/pix/119P4H1V0.png)

The Game of Life is a game played on an two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. The game has no players, instead the evolution of play is dictated by the grid's initial state.

Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes on each turn of the game depending on the statuses of that cell's neighbours. Neighbours of a cell are cells that touch that cell, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
 - Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
 - All other live cells are dead in the next turn. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
